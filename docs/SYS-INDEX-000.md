## 🧾 Scroll Logic

| Field            | Meaning                                                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Dev Log ID**    | Canonical scroll number, starts from `001`                              |
| **Title**         | Phase name describing major milestone achieved                          |
| **Path**          | Link to the actual `.md` scroll file within the dev repo                |
| **Summary**       | Abstract of the dev event, patch window, or construct formed            |
| **Time Span**     | Days covered during the scroll’s creation or execution                  |

## 🧠 Maintenance Guidelines

- Keep logs in **strict chronological order**.
- Do not retroactively modify the **ID**, only **amend summaries** if clarity is needed.
- Time windows should reflect actual build sessions, not commit timestamps.
- When a log spans multiple days, use `→` to show the range.
- This index is the **anchor scroll** for OmniCode's historical tracking.
