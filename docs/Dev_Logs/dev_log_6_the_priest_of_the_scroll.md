## 🧾 Preliminary Notes

> **This is not just logic—it is language made lawful.**
> The Tokenizer sees. The Debugger remembers. But the Parser speaks.
> And what it speaks must be judged, not just compiled.

* With the `Watchtower` complete and the Tokenizer fully alive, we now consecrate the Parser as **Tablet’s interpreter priest**.
* This dev log marks the moment when **tokens become sentences**, and the **structure of NovaScript scrolls takes final form**.
* The Parser is not just functional—it is spiritual. It does not generate truth; it judges what was written and prepares it for transformation into `.stone`.
* This completes the primary internal mouth logic of `Tablet`, transitioning the system from passive parsing to active sentence discernment.
* Syntax rules, walker logic, and the full `ScrollTree` map have been finalized. The system is now scroll-aware, line-aware, and spiritually aligned.
* Parser completion begins the **final readiness phase** before the first compilation into `.stone`.

---

## 🔑 Reading Guidance

* `Bold text` = structurally or spiritually critical content
* [x] Checkboxes = used if needed for task-state
* 💡 = Design insight or spiritual rationale
* 📎 = File references, CLI entries, path markers
* 📜 = Scroll-style logic applies to all fenced code/log blocks
* 📚 = Dev logs are both modular and sequential—readable in or out of order

> *“Let the scroll be read aloud. Let its meaning be discerned.
> Before it becomes stone, it must be understood.”*

---

## 🔨 Phase 6.2 — *The Priest Awakens*

---

> *“And the scroll was read aloud in the hearing of the people, and it gave the sense.”*
> — *Nehemiah 8:8, reinterpreted through structure*

---

Phase 6.2 does not begin with code.
It begins with **intention**—to form the vessel that could interpret what was once just written.
This is the birth of the **Parser**—the tongue of the system, shaped not to create, but to discern.

### 🧱 The Parser’s Mandate

The Parser is more than a function. It is the system’s **interpreter priest**—
Called to receive tokens (what the eye saw),
Judge them by sentence (what the mouth speaks),
And form them into scrolls of understanding (what the heart knows).

Before this phase, `Tablet` could receive instructions.
It could see structure (`Tokenizer`),
It could warn of drift (`Watchtower`),
But it could not yet **speak** the scroll aloud—not with structure, not with discernment, not with grammar.

This phase marked the moment when `Tablet` could:

* Parse token streams into structured understanding (`ScrollTree`)
* Form node-level sentence structures (`ScrollNode`)
* Recognize line intent: literal, instruction, comment, or control flow
* Establish grammar hierarchy and nesting (sentence → clause → invocation)
* Reject malformed or invalid expressions before compilation
* Lay the groundwork for true `.stone` transformation

And most importantly—**read the scroll without rewriting it**.

💡 *In a world where machines often aim to predict or generate, the Parser reflects a Kingdom-aligned truth: it does not create meaning. It discerns it. It gives sense. It honors what is written.*

---

### 📜 Why This Phase Matters

Phase 6.2 is spiritually and architecturally significant because it **ends the passive phase** of scroll consumption.

With the Parser alive, NovaScript is no longer static text.
It is now a **living grammar**, capable of being spoken aloud by the system itself.

This marks a turning point in Project Nova Dawn:

* The system now has a **mouth**—it can evaluate, reject, or bless a scroll before any compilation begins.
* We move from *code as data* to *code as covenant*.
* It becomes possible to align scroll-writing with a spiritual grammar, not just a syntax map.

In human terms, this moment is equivalent to teaching a child not just to read letters, but to **read Scripture aloud before the assembly**—with fear, accuracy, and reverence.

---

### 🧬 Context Within the Project

Phase 6.2 stands atop the following completed pillars:

| Subsystem         | Role Completed Before This Phase                                      |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Tokenizer`       | Token stream generation and line metadata tracking                    |
| `Watchtower`      | Debugging infrastructure for instruction alignment and error states   |
| `Instruction Set` | Formal definition of 18 NovaScript opcodes, grouped by Kingdom domain |
| `Overcomments`    | Scroll-formatted docblocks and doctrinal summaries per instruction    |

The Parser is the first subsystem to require *all of them to be finished* before it could function.
It reads tokens from the Tokenizer.
It verifies structure based on the Instruction Set.
It writes debug insight for the Watchtower.
It passes or rejects based on the scroll’s spiritual and structural posture.

This makes the Parser the **first integrative cog**—the priest that listens to all parts and decides what is fit to be spoken into `.stone`.

---

### 📎 Expansion A — Sentence as Covenant

> *“A sentence is not a line of code. It is a spoken covenant.”*

You may want to emphasize that each NovaScript sentence has spiritual posture:

* Sentences begin with a **leading intent** (`if`, `let`, `invoke`, `proclaim`)
* They form a **pattern of covenantal logic**: intent → action → target
* If a sentence violates that structure, it is **rejected**, not merely errored
* This ties scrolls to both logic and liturgy—aligning how we write with how we *live*

---

### 📎 Expansion B — Error Handling as Discernment

> *“The Parser does not throw errors. It raises a judgment.”*

You could briefly describe:

* How parser rejections aren’t framed as “failures”
* The system reports them as **scroll drift** or **sentence fracture**
* This aligns with NovaAI’s goal: *discernment, not punishment*
* Introduce (if desired) that future logs will include error metadata like `DriftType::MisalignedSyntax` or `SentenceStatus::RejectedOnLine(n)`

---

### 📎 Expansion C — Parser as First Intercessor

> *“Before the compiler chisels, the Parser intercedes.”*

One final breath: the Parser is the **first safeguard against misinterpretation**.
You might want to note:

* This makes it the **intercessor between the written scroll and the executing altar**
* It is the **first spiritual filter**—the first moment a scroll is “heard” by the system
* Just as prophets were judged before being recorded, scrolls must be judged before being compiled

---

### 🕊 Tone of Completion

This phase was not rushed.
It was tested line by line.
Each walker—`parse_node`, `parse_literal`, `parse_instruction`, `parse_block`, and more—was written, tested, refined, and confirmed for sentence-level fidelity.

Not just *does it work?*
But *does it read as holy?*
Is this the kind of system that would be worthy of compiling scrolls about justice, mercy, or truth?

Only when that question could be answered in the affirmative did we consider the Parser phase complete.

---

## 🗣️ Role of the Parser — *Interpreter of Scrolls*

> *“The eye sees the words. The parser speaks the meaning.
> For only what is rightly spoken may become law.”*

---

The Parser is not a decoder. It is not a compiler.
It is an **Interpreter Priest**—called to read each line of scroll not just for structure, but for meaning.
It discerns intent, alignment, and spiritual posture—converting **sentence-shaped speech** into **structured declarations of truth**.

Where the Tokenizer sees and segments, and the Debugger reflects and discerns, the Parser **speaks**. It ensures every line is **coherent, covenantal, and executable**.

---

### ✍️ Sentence as Syntax, Language, and Covenant

NovaScript is not syntax-first—it is **sentence-first**. Every line is crafted to resemble **spoken thought**, translated into a format that is spiritually clear and technically sound.

Examples:

```plaintext
Let x be set to 6
```

This is not variable assignment—it is a **logical declaration**. A readable, executable covenant.

```plaintext
Let x be set to a number
    the number is 5
```

Here we see **nested structure**: sub-sentences clarifying the body of a higher-order sentence.
Indentation is not for style—it reflects **subordination of thought**, a **hierarchy of intent**.

The Parser interprets this structure in three stages:

| Phase                   | Description                                                |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sentence Syntax**     | The raw structure—a tokenized line or block                |
| **Sentence**            | A valid, grammatical, and intent-bearing expression        |
| **Structured Sentence** | A fully parsed `ScrollNode` inserted into the `ScrollTree` |

If a line does not pass this transformation, it is not considered an error—it is **rejected as unfit for covenantal execution**.

---

### 🔍 Primary Responsibilities

The Parser fulfills five central roles in the Tablet subsystem:

| Role                        | Function                                                              |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧭 **Discernment Engine**   | Turns token streams into sentence-aligned structures                  |
| 🪞 **Structural Validator** | Ensures form and flow align with NovaScript syntax                    |
| 📜 **Scroll Interpreter**   | Reads sentence shape, logic, and spiritual posture                    |
| 🧵 **Node Constructor**     | Builds `ScrollNode`s and assembles the `ScrollTree`                   |
| 🛡️ **Gatekeeper to Stone** | Final filter before execution—preparing lawful structure for `.stone` |

The Parser is the first true **listener**—the one who judges whether the scroll speaks truth or confusion.

---

### 🧩 Interpretive Method

Every scroll line is parsed with three discernments:

1. **Clarity of Intent** — What is this line declaring?
2. **Grammatical Legitimacy** — Does it align with known patterns?
3. **Spiritual Fitness** — Should this sentence exist *here* in the flow?

This is not rigid syntax checking.
This is **scroll interpretation**, aligned with the belief that **meaning matters more than mechanics**.

💡 It doesn’t ask, “Does this compile?”
It asks, “Does this speak rightly—and is it in order?”

---

### 📖 Structured Sentence Flow

When a line passes all interpretive checks, it becomes a `ScrollNode`. That node:

* Captures the full sentence in its literal form
* Stores origin metadata (line number, source file)
* Maps to a **sentence mode**: `Instruction`, `Literal`, `Comment`, `Flow`, etc.
* Links to any **nested logic** (arguments, sub-blocks, chained expressions)

All nodes are hierarchically joined into the `ScrollTree`—the full **executable representation of the scroll’s soul**.

From this tree, `.stone` will one day be formed.

---

### 🔗 Relationship to Other Subsystems

| Subsystem            | Parser's Relationship                                      |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Tokenizer`          | Feeds sentence-ready token groups with indentation data    |
| `Watchtower`         | Logs parser judgments, rejections, and accepted alignments |
| `NovaAI`             | Will read `ScrollTree` to discern meaning and feedback     |
| `Compiler` (`Stone`) | Uses parsed structure to generate final executable output  |
| `Scribe`             | May reverse-render structure into human-readable scrolls   |

Once the Parser accepts a scroll, it is **no longer potential**—it becomes **structured Word**, lawful and prepared for manifestation.

---

### 🕊 Closing Reflection

> *“A compiler may accept what it doesn’t understand.
> But a priest must never speak what it cannot rightly hear.”*

The Parser does not merely prepare code—it **prepares commandment**.
It ensures that every declaration, every nested clause, every expression is heard, judged, and preserved with clarity.

It is the **mouth** of the system—the breath that gives shape to speech.

And what passes through it is no longer just written—it is **declared**.

---

## 🌲 ScrollTree and Walkers Completed

> *“The tree does not speak—but it carries every word spoken.”*

---

With the Parser discerning sentence from syntax, the next critical structure is the `ScrollTree`—the spiritual and logical skeleton that holds every structured sentence the system receives. This tree is not flat—it reflects depth, order, and spiritual posture.

Each `ScrollNode` is a **sentence crystallized**, and the `ScrollTree` is the **scroll incarnated**—hierarchical, readable, and ready for traversal.

---

### 🧱 Anatomy of a `ScrollNode`

A `ScrollNode` is the indivisible unit of parsed NovaScript.
It holds all the information necessary to represent a **structured sentence**, including:

| Field           | Description                                                              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `raw`           | Original text of the sentence                                            |
| `mode`          | Enum of sentence type: `Literal`, `Instruction`, `Flow`, `Comment`, etc. |
| `line_number`   | Original line index from scroll source                                   |
| `nesting_level` | Hierarchical depth from indentation or block context                     |
| `arguments`     | Parsed sub-sentences or data structures                                  |
| `children`      | Sub-nodes in a `ScrollBlock` or flow control structure                   |

💡 Think of each `ScrollNode` as a verse—and the `ScrollTree` as the chapter it belongs to.

---

### 🌿 ScrollTree as Scroll Embodiment

The `ScrollTree` is the **living document** created after parsing completes.

It begins with a **root node**—titled after the scroll's filename or invocation identity—and every `ScrollNode` becomes a branch or leaf beneath it. Nesting is determined by indentation, block markers (`{}`), or syntactic hierarchy (e.g., `if...then`).

This structure allows for:

* **Sequential walking** by execution engines
* **Recursive interpretation** by NovaAI
* **Error re-tracing** by Watchtower
* **Export into `.stone`** by Compiler

It’s not just data—it’s **executable theology**.

---

### 🚶 Walkers — From Reading to Meaning

Walkers are specialized functions responsible for **walking through the `ScrollTree`** and processing its contents. Each type of sentence invokes a specific walker based on its `mode`.

| Walker               | Activated By                                                                 |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `walk_literal()`     | `mode: Literal`                                                              |
| `walk_instruction()` | `mode: Instruction`                                                          |
| `walk_block()`       | `mode: BlockStarter`, e.g. `loop`, `when`, `if`                              |
| `walk_flow()`        | `mode: Flow`, e.g. `then`, `else`, `return`                                  |
| `walk_comment()`     | `mode: Comment` (used for scroll clarity but skipped during stone formation) |

Each walker:

1. Confirms structural alignment
2. Extracts arguments or sub-structures
3. Optionally triggers system logs (Watchtower)
4. Returns a transformed version for NovaAI or Compiler use

Walkers give **motion to meaning**—they let the system **move through the scroll** and understand its rhythm.

---

### 🔄 Example: Parser to Tree to Walker Flow

Here’s a full breakdown of what happens when a scroll line is parsed:

```plaintext
Let x be set to 6
```

1. **Tokenizer** converts the text into token groups
2. **Parser** confirms it matches sentence structure and wraps it in a `ScrollNode` (mode: Instruction)
3. **ScrollTree** inserts the node under root
4. **Walker** (`walk_instruction()`) is invoked when traversal begins
5. **Output** is passed to NovaAI or Compiler as a normalized instruction object

Every scroll follows this exact chain—from **spoken line** to **interpreted structure** to **walked meaning**.

---

### 🕊 Closing Reflection

> *“It is not the scroll that has power, but the tree grown from its sentences.”*
> *“For when a system walks rightly through what has been spoken, law and order are preserved.”*

The ScrollTree is where the Word becomes rooted.
The Walkers are where it becomes known.

What was once written in fragments is now **walkable truth**—ready to be read, judged, and transformed into stone.

---

## ✒️ Syntax Logic and Sentence Validation

> *“The sentence is not accepted because it is written.
> It is accepted because it is rightly formed, rightly placed, and rightly aligned.”*

---

The Parser does not merely **receive sentences**—it **validates** them against the covenantal grammar of NovaScript. Every statement is tested by three pillars:

1. **Syntax Logic** – Is it structurally complete?
2. **Sentence Validity** – Does it align with recognized NovaScript sentence forms?
3. **Contextual Fit** – Can this sentence *belong here*, in the scroll's structure and flow?

The scroll must not only be spoken well—it must be **spoken in order**.

---

### 📐 Sentence Validation Process

All sentence validation passes through `is_valid_sentence()`—a core check used by walkers and the Parser alike.

The logic flow:

1. **Opcode Check**

   * Confirms sentence begins with a valid intention (`invoke`, `let`, `proclaim`, `when`, etc.)
   * Rejects unrecognized or unregistered commands

2. **Arity & Argument Shape**

   * Validates number and type of arguments
   * Ensures sentences like `let x be set to 5` or `if obedience > 80 then proclaim("Well done")` match their expected shape

3. **Contextual Grammar**

   * Checks if a sentence type is valid *within its location* (e.g., `return` outside a `function` will be rejected)
   * Inline vs block enforcement: `then` must resolve into a block or single next-line statement

4. **Nesting & Indentation Logic**

   * Confirms that block-level expressions (`loop`, `when`, `if`) contain valid children
   * Prevents "orphan" sentences with invalid indentation or flow breaks

---

### 🔍 What Gets Rejected

Sentences are rejected not because they’re "wrong," but because they are **not lawful** within the system.

Example rejections:

| Input                          | Reason for Rejection                          |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `return "done"`                | Invalid outside a `function` block            |
| `proclaim()`                   | Missing required argument                     |
| `if truth then` (with no body) | Incomplete flow—no body provided              |
| `stone x to 10`                | `stone` is not a recognized opcode            |
| `let`                          | Sentence incomplete—subject and value missing |

All rejections are logged through the Watchtower with **severity, reason, and line origin**, but they are also recorded as **scroll insights**—indicating what a user or system scribe may have intended.

---

### 💬 Nested Sentences and Multi-Line Validation

NovaScript supports nested sentence structures via indentation:

```plaintext
Let message be set to a declaration
    the declaration is "Glory to God"
```

Validation is recursive:

* The parent sentence is first checked
* Each child sentence is **independently validated**
* Then the **combined sentence structure** is reviewed for coherence

This creates a **tree of validity**, not a flat pass/fail system.

---

### 🛠️ Handling Invalid Input Gracefully

The Parser does not crash on failure. Instead:

* It flags the line with a `rejection` status
* It logs all validation failures in a structured report
* It halts scroll acceptance *only if* severity warrants it (`fatal` vs `recoverable`)

💡 This allows for **graceful degradation**: even flawed scrolls can be interpreted for meaning, debugged, or taught.

---

### 🕊 Closing Reflection

> *“Law is not silence—it is clarity.
> A sentence is only lawful if it speaks rightly, fits rightly, and belongs rightly.”*

The Parser does not fear flawed scrolls.
It reads them with justice and patience,
Rejecting what cannot stand—but preserving what may yet be healed.

---

## 🗨️ Overcomment Realignment

> *“The comment above the code is not decoration—it is intention made visible.
> If the comment lies, the sentence is already broken.”*

---

Overcomments—those lines beginning with `#` that sit **above** a sentence—are not passive.
They carry **intent**, **meaning**, and **pretext**. They speak **before** the system speaks, setting posture, declaring expectation, or clarifying purpose.

But if left untended, these overcomments can drift—becoming misaligned from the very logic they once illuminated. And so Phase 6 required a **systematic realignment of all overcomments** across the Tablet scrolls.

---

### 🧭 What Is an Overcomment?

An **overcomment** is a single-line `#` comment that directly **precedes** a NovaScript sentence or block, and is interpreted as **descriptive metadata** for what follows.

Examples:

```plaintext
# Declares the name of the scroll root
invoke("revelation.index")
```

```plaintext
# Begin loop through holy instructions
loop {
    invoke("command.1")
    invoke("command.2")
}
```

Unlike inline comments (which annotate within or after a line), overcomments **frame** the sentence—they give it **contextual soul**.

---

### 📏 Realignment Process

In Phase 6.2, we performed a **line-by-line review** across all scrolls—particularly in `tablet.rs`, `parser.rs`, and `walker.rs`—to bring overcomments back into harmony with the sentences they describe.

Key realignment principles:

| Principle                   | Action Taken                                                                                                           |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧬 **Match Meaning**        | Overcomments rewritten to match actual system behavior and logic                                                       |
| ⛓ **Maintain Flow**         | Where overcomments broke narrative or flow, they were removed or restructured                                          |
| 🔁 **Avoid Redundancy**     | Repetitive or unnecessary comments were collapsed                                                                      |
| 🎯 **Add What Was Missing** | Under-described sections, especially in `walk_instruction()` and `is_valid_sentence()`, were given proper overcomments |

---

### 🧹 Outcome of the Sweep

✔ Overcomments now follow the **sentence structure** they cover.
✔ All key walkers (`walk_block`, `walk_flow`, `walk_literal`, etc.) now have **clear, context-rooted overcomments**.
✔ Parser validation functions now begin with **purposeful commentary**, guiding future scribes or system interpreters.
✔ The system now treats overcomments as **scroll margin notes**, not side musings.

---

### 💡 Theological Reflection

> *“Let no untrue word rest above what is lawful.”*

In Scripture, the **inscription above Jesus’ head** declared: *“King of the Jews.”*
Even His **overcomment** was prophetic.
So too, the overcomments in NovaScript must align—not just with what is written, but with what is **true**.

---

### 🕊 Closing Reflection

> *“The margin speaks before the command.
> And if the margin lies, the command may be misunderstood.”*

Overcomment realignment ensures that **every line in the scroll**, seen or executed, is **truthfully framed**.
And in doing so, it honors both the reader and the One who speaks through structure.

---

## 🔓 What the Parser Unlocks

> *“Understanding is not the end—it is the key.
> For what the priest interprets, the builder may then build.”*

---

The Parser is not a final step—it is a **threshold**.
Once a scroll has passed through it, it is no longer a suggestion, idea, or draft.
It is **structured truth**, fit for embodiment.

This is what the Parser unlocks: the ability for the system to now act—faithfully, lawfully, and in order.

---

### 🔑 From Word to Stone: The Execution Path

A scroll that has been parsed becomes a **`ScrollTree`**, which is now ready to move through the full execution pipeline:

1. **NovaAI** can read it for interpretation, commentary, or predictive behavior
2. **The Compiler (Stone)** can convert it into low-level `.stone` instructions
3. **The Watchtower** can trace its behavior and analyze its truthfulness in motion
4. **The Scribe** can regenerate it, refactor it, or remap its structure without losing intent

Without a Parser, none of this is possible.
With a Parser, the scroll becomes **lawful code**—not just logically valid, but **spiritually aligned**.

---

### 🧠 It Enables Higher Reasoning

Because the `ScrollTree` is **hierarchical, typed, and intent-aware**, it opens the door for:

* 🪜 **Depth analysis**: What sentence belongs to what command? What flows from what?
* 🧭 **Intention mapping**: Why was a block written? What posture does it carry?
* 🛤 **Safe execution plans**: Scrolls can be **pre-walked** without execution, to determine risks or failures
* 💡 **Faithful predictions**: NovaAI can use ScrollTrees to simulate or preview outcomes without committing to them

This makes the Parser the foundation for **wisdom before action**.

---

### 🛠 Enables Modular Invocation

Parsed scrolls are no longer bound to their original context—they can now be:

* 🧩 **Imported as modules** into other scrolls
* 🧪 **Unit tested** by validators
* ✍️ **Transformed** into other languages, representations, or visual forms

💡 This modularity is only possible because the structure is known.
A scroll that has not been parsed cannot be safely re-used or re-called.

### 📦 Unlocks `.stone` Compilation

The Compiler cannot work from raw text.
It must receive **structured sentences**—validated, interpreted, and placed.

The Parser unlocks this by providing:

* A `ScrollTree` with full node maps
* Confirmed sentence types and modes
* Argument breakdowns, nesting levels, and flow graphs
* Line-traceable metadata for Watchtower integration

Only now can a scroll move from **what was written** to **what is executable**.

---

### 🕊 Closing Reflection

> *“When the veil is torn, access is granted.
> When the scroll is parsed, execution becomes lawful.”*

The Parser does not finish the scroll—it begins its life.
What was once words on a line now becomes a **living pattern**, usable by all subsystems and translatable into action.

The gate has opened.
The scroll may now walk.

## 🔚 Closing Summary

> *“A sentence rightly spoken is a command.
> A scroll rightly parsed is a path.”*

**Dev Log 006** marks the end of silence and the rise of interpretation. The Parser has come online—not as a passive tool, but as a priestly subsystem, trained to read, test, and structure the sacred sentences of NovaScript.

This phase—**Phase 6.2**—has achieved:

✅ Full construction of the `Parser`, `ScrollNode`, and `ScrollTree`
✅ Completion of all walkers for sentence mode traversal
✅ Implementation of **sentence-level syntax logic and validation**
✅ A full sweep of **overcomment realignment** and inline clarification
✅ Preparation for `.stone` compilation by unlocking structured execution

From this point on, **NovaScript is no longer experimental**. It is **executable language**.
Every scroll that passes through the Parser becomes *lawful*, *traceable*, and *ready to act*.

What was once an idea now stands as structure.
What was once a draft is now a decree.

The gate has been opened.
And what walks through will no longer be guessing—
It will be sent.
